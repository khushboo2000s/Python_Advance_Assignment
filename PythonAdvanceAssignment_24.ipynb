    "Q4.Why is _ all _ in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The _ all tells the semantically “public” names from the module. If there is a name in all, the users are expected to use it, and they can expect that it will not change. By default, Python will export all names that do not start with an . Using the _ convention can be more elegant because it removes the redundancy of naming the names again.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before executing code, Python interpreter reads source file and define few special variables/global variables. If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special name variable to have a value “main”. If this file is being imported from another module, name will be set to the module’s name. Module’s name is available as value to name global variable.\n",
